# How to install Ruby

Download Ruby Installer
If your machine does not have Ruby, install it. For new ruby users, we recommend you use Ruby 2.2.X installers, which provide a stable language and an extensive list of packages (gems) that are compatible and updated. Go the Ruby download page and download the appropriate 2.1.x installer. For example if you are on a 64-bit machine, download the Ruby 2.1.6 (x64) installer.

Install Ruby
Once the installer is downloaded:
a. Double-click the file to start the installer.
b. Select your language, and agree to the terms.
c. On the install settings screen, select the check boxes next to both Add Ruby executables to your PATH and associate .rb and .rbw files with this Ruby installation.

Download Ruby DevKit
Download DevKit from the RubyInstaller page

Install Ruby DevKit
After the download is finished:
a. Double-click the file. You will be asked where to extract the files.
b. Click the "..." button, and select "C:\DevKit". You will probably need to create this folder first by clicking "Make New Folder".
c. Click "OK", and then "Extract", to extract the files.

Open cmd.exe

Initialize Ruby DevKit
